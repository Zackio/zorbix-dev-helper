## What is it?

A collection of tools made to support development of Zorbix themes.

These are functions useful for development not appropriate for inclution in the actual theme. They are helper functions that aren't at all needed.

This project wont be worked on further as it would be better to be a WP CLI plugin instead. 

## What can it do?

Makes available these helper functions

### write_log

Outputting to error_log if WP_DEBUG is enabled.

### zbx_globals_checker

Outputs all functions to the screen.
